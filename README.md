🩺 MediBot – AI-Powered Medical Chatbot using RAG and LangChain

MediBot is a medical question-answering chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide precise, context-aware answers to user queries. It uses LangChain, FAISS for vector storage, Hugging Face for LLM integration, and Streamlit for an intuitive web interface.
By using the RAG and the Langchain, and FAISS for vector storage it is much more campatible and much more capable of generating and predicting the right answer for the user according to its usecase.

⚙️ How It Works

Medical documents are embedded into vector space using SentenceTransformers.

User queries are processed via LangChain's RetrievalQA chain.

FAISS retrieves relevant context; the LLM responds based on this evidence.

Responses are streamed through a Streamlit chatbot UI.

▶️ Running the App

Clone the repository

Install dependencies (pipenv or pip):

pip install -r requirements.txt or pipenv install

Run the chatbot:

streamlit run medibot.py

Note: You’ll need a Hugging Face API token and repo ID.

🩻 Use Case

MediBot is designed for educational and informational purposes only. It demonstrates how domain-specific LLMs combined with retrieval techniques can deliver more accurate and trustworthy answers.
